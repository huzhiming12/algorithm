/**
 * Created by huzhiming on 2017/8/11.
 * Description:
 * Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition
 * is a palindrome.
 * Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
 * <p>
 * For example, given s = "aab",
 * Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
